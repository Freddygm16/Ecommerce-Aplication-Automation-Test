	 TODO's:
	 
	 1- Create a new package to save reusable test components, example: test configurations, dynamic initializations. (check)
	 2- In testComponents package create a BaseTest class to save all configuration. (check)

	 11- Implement in baseTest After annotation to close the browser. (check)
	 12- Implement a new test to validate message error in login. (check)
	 13- Add the method to validate the product is in the cart to errorValidations class since the functionality verifies 
	     the errors and it related with class category is othrwise to order the code. (check)
	 14- Create test.xml and configure two tests one with submitOrder test and another with errorValidations tests in new folder name´s "testSuites".  (check)
